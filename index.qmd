title: Introduction

Welcome to this course on data analysis using R! This course is aimed at the intermediate R developer who wants to learn  how to do useful data analysis tasks in R. It will focus on "modern R", specifically using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) collection of packages which are designed for data science.

For the purpose of this course we will be using RStudio which provides you with a text editor and R console. Setting up instructions can be found [here](/pages/010-workspace-setup.qmd).

### Intended learning outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- Feel confident installing and using packages
- Know how to write functions
- Be familiar with `tydiverse` ecosystem
- Know how to read, filter and transform data 


## How to read this documentation

In this documentation, any time that we are seeing a small snippet of R code, we'll see it written in a grey box like the following:

```{.R}
cat("Hello, R")
```

If the commands are executed by the machine we will see the output of them below enclosed on a vertical purple line:

```{r}
cat("Hello, R!")
```

By contrast, you will see larger pices of code as scripts with a given name, e.g. `script.R`, in a code block with darker header:

```{.R filename="script.R"}
name <- "Jean Golding"
cat("Hello,", name, "!")
```

We may ask you to run a script using the `Command Prompt` (Windows) or `Terminal` (Mac and Linux). We will show you what commands to run and will look like this:
```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
Rscript script.R
```

In some cases we will introduce general programming concepts and structures using pseudocode, a high-level, easy-to-read syntax close to natural language. This should not be confused with R code and cannot be executed on your machine, but it is useful to describe how your code should behave. Here there is an example:
```
FOR EACH sample IN my_study
    IF (sample.value > 100)
        DO SOMETHING
    OTHERWISE
        DO SOMETHING ELSE
```


There are some exercices along this course, and it is important you try to answer them yourself to understand how R works. Exercises are shown in blue boxes followed by a yellow box that contains the answer of each exercise. We recommend you to try to answer each exercise yourself before looking at the solution. 

::: {#exerciseN .callout-note icon=false title='Exercise'}
This is an exercise. You will need to click in the below box to see the answer.
:::

::: {#answerN .callout-caution icon=false title='Answer (click to open)' collapse="true"}
This is the answer.

Last, we will highlight important points using green boxes like this one:

::: {#keypointsN .callout-tip icon=false title='Key points'}
These are important concepts and technical notes.
